# Pulse - Docker Compose Configuration
#
# System Design Note:
# This setup demonstrates the three-layer architecture:
# - redis: Infrastructure layer (shared state)
# - pulse-api: Control Plane (receives jobs, enqueues)
# - pulse-worker: Data Plane (processes jobs)
#
# In production, you'd run multiple instances of each service
# behind a load balancer. Docker Compose makes this easy for
# development and testing.
