# Pulse - Development Docker Compose
#
# System Design Note:
# This override file enables hot-reload during development.
# It mounts source code as volumes and uses tsx for watch mode.
# This is faster for iteration but not suitable for production.
#
# Note: When used with docker-compose.yml, this file extends it.
# Redis is included here for clarity and to make dev setup self-contained.
# In dev, Redis typically doesn't need persistence (faster restarts).
